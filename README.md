# dormitory_SSH

Dormitory Management System based on the B/ S Structure of  j2ee: 
-Dormitory Management System uses a integration technology of the mainstream framework of J2EE which is included in typical MVC mode, SSH ( struts framework, spring framework, hibernate framework), to design and achieve data system managing module- dao, model module, service module, error handle module-tool.
-Tools: MyEclipse, JDK, Tomcat7.0, SQL server2012

These code only includes the part I wrote. I haven't submit the j2ee framework.
